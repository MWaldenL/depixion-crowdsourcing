    Hello! 
    We are Keith, Mats, and Byron, senior students from the 
    College of Computer Studies of De La Salle University - Manila taking up BS Computer Science with specializations in Software Technology. 
    We are currently working on our thesis project entitled "Generating Abstract Art Based on a User-Specified 
    Emotion Spectrum". Our goal is to build a software that can create abstract paintings through emotions, 
    and we need your help! <br><br>

    In answering the survey in this website, you will be shown 10 abstract paintings, and you will tell us 
    the emotions that you feel from them. You will be allowed to answer the survey again if you wish to do so. <br><br>

    For any concerns or questions regarding this website or our project, in general, you may reach us through
    <a href="mailto: depixion.2022@gmail.com">depixion.2022@gmail.com</a>. <br><br>
    Thank you very much for your interest in our study!
